Terminal: Its a kind of app that handles the input from user and displays the output . For example : In Mac os we have iTerm2 or in windows its putty.
Shell : Its a command line interface. It provides an interface between the user and the kernel and executes programs called commands. 
Types of Shell : Bash Shell , ZSH shell . 
How to check which shell are we using : echo $SHELL.
echo is like print statement , it will show the value for the arguments passed here as a input like $SHELL(means get the value of SHELL command)
Once we open Terminal it will have option like this :
[root@ins-dm-gjtestmysql101z ~]# ==> So basically here root is the user on server , @ is seprator and ins-dm-gjtestmysql101z is the hostname of machine .
Hostname is basically the name of server by which it will be called in the network . It can be viewed using the command : hostname.
Scenario: Lets say if am running python3 command , how does system will understand if its executable or its a file . Basically behind the scene it run 
the commmand "where python3 " and it will be execute then ==> where python3 (o/p =Note âˆ’ /usr/local/bin/python3 is the path of the Python directory.)
ls : list of files in present working directory
ls -a : Show all the hidden files in the directory
pwd: present working directory 
Once i open a new directory it will by default point to my home directory i.e /Users/kriti
Whatever command i will run , it will execute in the same folder where currently i will be pointing to 
mkdir test : Create a new folder with test name
cd test: Change current working directory/folder to test folder
cd.. : To get one folder back from current working directory
Environment variable in linux : Environment variables allow to customize how the system works and the behavior of the applications on the system. 
echo $PATH : It specifies the directories to be searched to find a command . like if we run python3 command it is going to search that executable command 
in each of the location specfied in PATH Env variable.
cat ~/.bashrc. ==> Cat displays the content of a file . So basically here it means to open display the content of bashrc file located in home directory
bashrc is a file that will automatically be loaded once a interactive terminal open . So all kind of env variable settings or alias setting we store here
alias : Alias in shell means to set short names for a long command like [alias a="docker run nginx"] . Now if we run "a" then it will call "docker run nginx"
Now to set environment variable in shell we need to use export command like [export mysql_password="my-secret-pw"]. This will only be valid for a particular
terminal session . If you need change permanent then make change in bashrc file as explained above .
echo $mysql_password ==> Will give value of mysql_password variable.
cat > file.txt. ==>Creating and writing to the same file 
My name is kriti and to do exit press (ctrl+c)
Now see content of file.txt , it will show the content as "My name is kriti"  


Assignments:
1. get hostname of your machine
2. Export two variables named as MY_SQL_USER and MY_SQL_PASSWORD
3. Echo the two variable values
4. Export the above two variables in bashrc file.
5. List all hiddden files in your home directory.
6. Create a directory in your home folder named as test and inside the test folder create file my_intro with content as your name.
